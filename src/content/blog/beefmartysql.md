## Recently

Been doing a lot of physical activity and adjusting my physical activity regiments. I have been doing less workouts per week as of late because of the holidays and spending a lot of time with friends and family but it is still more than enough of what I need in order to grow muscle and endurance. I have been pushing it pretty hard for weight training and been running a lot which is pretty good. Frequency will go up pretty soon though.

Got new runnning shoes today. Sauconey Endorphin Speed 5's. Flipping amazing. Shout out my cousin for the recommendation. I have been using these mid tier Nike running shoes for a long time and upgrading to a proper, comfortable running shoe was a game changer. All it took was one run to deem these shoes on the level of absolute royalty. Its kind of crazy to think about that the wealthiest people in the world a couple of hundred years ago never had the chance to embrace the comfortability of a proper shoe. I guess that makes me the wealthiest man in the world (a couple hundred years ago).

But I have been having a good time. Coding/learning, working, training, spending time with family and friends. Christmas happened recently which was fun. Also New Years is coming up soon.

## Christmas

Christmas was very fun. A lot of family. A lot of drinking and eating and talking. I did not buy or recieve a single gift this year which is perfect. My (immediate) family and I came to this agreement and it is amazing. I think I liked this condition considering that I am one who is not materialistic at all, and if I were to buy something, I would need to be the one to get it because I have a very specific taste. But overall, amazing Christmas with the family. 

## New Years

New Years is coming. That only means one thing. A packed gym. The worst time for any consistent gym goer. The positive is that there are new faces that actually stick and start their gym journey. The negative is how absolutely crowded it gets in there. And I go to a very small gym. 

### New Years Gym
This is random but I use to go to Crunch when my friend/gym partner/trainer use to let me and my brother in for free. New Years came around and it go so flipping packed. But I remember seeing people with cameras and make up and just all that extra stuff. I feel like people go in there to prove something to others rather than themselves. I guess you do want to look good for others, I would be lying if I said I didn't but the main reason I go consitently and still am sticking to it after years is because I do it for myself. The main reasons:

- Sculpting your body into something beautiful, like those ancient marble statues (ex: Hercules)
- The feeling you get when you push heavy weight is so empowering
- Keeps me from going insane (this is probably a con considering my dependency on the gym but can be seen as a pro)
- The pump (It's probably the closest thing you would get to knowing how a gladiator felt in their prime days, with blood coursing through your veins like crazy and inflating your muscles) 
- Running is so relieving and primal and healthy
- I think being jacked is cool

I am not in a place to give advice in any area of life but if I were it would be for the gym, and the advice would be to pursue your fitness goals and do it unapologetically (hopefully I spelt that right) without hurting/disturbing anybody else. I still lack in the part where I try to be in my own world but thats normal. You will meet a lot of cool and loving people in the gym though so that is cool. Also researching on how to train and eat properly is super fun. I went from talking about New Years to explaining why I love training. I guess this is why I maded this blog. To go on random tangents about whatever. I should probably talk about the goals I have for next year while I am on the topic.

### 2026 Goals

I want to hit 315lb on bench (I should probably start learing/using the kg system, what a rookie thing of me to do, maybe I'll add that to one of my things to learn for the new year) and I want to join the 1000lb club. I feel like the 1000lb club is really doable but the 315lb bench is going to be challenging. 

#### 1000lb Club 

I have a year to bring my numbers up to get closer to 1000lb. The best part is that all three of my movements have a lot of room to grow considering I specialize ONLY in body building. Now I will be dabbling in powerlifting and I strongly believe that dabbling is all I need to get me there. 

I have a good foundation for squat, my numbers aren't crazy there but my form is. I just need to slowly increment the weight and do more "consice" reps and sets. Like a little more sets and less reps with more weight. I would probably be doing that for all my movements. 

My bench is nothing crazy. I would say my form is there and I definitely have untapped strength that I need to learn how to harness but there is a lot of room for growth in this movement. I can slightly polist my form and start pushing a lot more for less reps.

Deadlift is going to be the issue. My form isn't perfect. Also I know its more injury prone. I need to spruce up my form and learn how to handle heavy weights. I also get that feeling of my lower back compressing/tightening and sometimes I want to throw up with heavier weights (not like literally but like 2 stages before barfing in you know what I mean?).

Current guesses on where my numbers are at:
- Bench: 240lb
- Squat: 275lb
- Deadlift: 300lb
- Total: 815lb

I am 185 lb away, theoretically. I just need to spread that weight amongst 3 movements and some of these movements will definitely see improvement. It is doable. But I want a 315 bench.

#### 315lb Bench

Why? Because I want to be able to look at myself in the mirror and know that I was capable of completing such a feat. How? Pure brute force. Just kidding I will plan and slowly and safely increment my way there. I will also get the help of my fellow gym goers who also bench 315. It will be hard but I want to be able to do it. If I don't do it I will not be disappointed, I just want to know that I at least attempted. 


## BEEF

I watched Beef. Super funny. I felt that sometimes it was holding a mirror super close to my face when I saw one of the characters acting angry or irrational. I am not an angry or irrational person at all but I do have my moments. The last episode was probably one of the greatest episodes I have ever seen in my life. 9/10

## Marty Crunchwrap Supreme

Very hectic, fast paced, and adventure packed. A young man who does everything and anything to see his goals through. Amazing movie. I remeber when I got out of the theater I thought it was a mid movie but that was my judgement being clouded by the constant need to take a piss throughout the entire movie. I drank a greentea before hand because my friends and I watched it at like 10:45pm. But yea, I now look back at the movie and vividly remember smiling, laughing out loud and having a good time. The movie was amazing. The setting was absolutely perfect too. Mostly taken place in 1950s New York. Plus the fits were on point. Marty was also a douche and strongly passionate which gave the movie a lot of extra flavor. Amazing movie. 9/10

## Onto the Backend

For the project I am currently working on I just started the backend. Frontend I want to say is pretty much complete. I do have to tweak and add some stuff that I forgot or wanted to add later down the line but yea. I am very much looking forward to making a clean, consistent backend. I remeber for other project I had a very nice and organized backend which I might take inspo from. 

### SQL 

Also now that I am starting the backend I wanted to use SQL instead of Mongo this time. I got a couple textbooks from my local library on SQL to learn/freshin up on my SQL skills and it sure is helping. It kind of brought to light how unstably and messy I learned SQL the first time. Relearning it now is and will be a great helping for keeping my project stable and organized. 

This is what I have been doing on my free time as of late. 

## Remembering The Boss

Every now and then I watch Metal Gear Solid 3 ending reactions on Youtube to remind me how goated the game is and how goated The Boss and Big Boss are. RIP The Boss.

## Tangent 

This was suppose to be a small blog but I clearly went on a tangent about random things here. That's fine. It felt could expressing what has been in my noggin recently. This is like journaling but kind of better considering my typing speed can keep up with my mind. When I journal in my notebook I find that my handwriting can't keep up with my mind, and sometimes my handwriting is not legible, also my hand cramps and I tend to hunch over wen writing. I need to start fixing my posture, also I need to start doing yoga.

Anyways this a small window into my constantly running mind. I hope you enjoyed my unrevised/un-spellchecked thoughts. (Imagine me agressively waving my arm over my head as a goodbye)
