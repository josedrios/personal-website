## It Sucks

When i search for a file, i get adds and search browser results. Perfect, i was totally looking for my file on the interwebs. I totally want to have preinstalled programs on my system that i will never utilize. I absolutely want you to have all my information and make it super hard to uninstall things. I would love for you to have a horrible terminal. 

## Why write this

I was laying in my bed after an hour fight with computer trying to install a program through their horrible terminal, my blutooth flickering on or off with my keyboard, and not being able to configure my keybinds the way i have my setup on t480. i need to find a window manager on windows if that even exists. But as i was saying i was just laying on my bed after my heart rate just went thorugh the roof after having this HORRIBLE experience with this stupid operating system. Dude im so done. u have no idea how bad im pressing my keys on my keyboard. i dont care about grammar or none of that here. this is just a rant. i dont care if a future employee or a friend views this blog and sees my "angry" side. I just hate this stupid, flipping operaitng system so bad im so done dude. 

I still need to use if for gaming but hopefully i get around to looking into proton and just leaving windows in the dirt

Not letting users remove stuff off their OWN computer. NEEDING AN ACCOUNT TO LOG INTO YOUR OWWNNNN COMPUTER. that is crazyyyy dude. I never really realized it when i was younger but when i switched to linux (not tryna be one of those dudes who becomes woke when you switch to linux but) you trully see how an OS should be like. windows is just filled with corporate greed, bad intentions, and horrible UX. im so done and over with it man. it has me so bent that i got out of bed after trying to calm down that i needed to share my thoguhts. this is so annoying man. how can anybody think that not being able to configure certian things ON YOUR OWN COMPUTER is best for the user?. why install stuff on my computer before i even deciced if i want it or not? why not let me look for files and folder in peace?

Im praying every day that their is a linux take over, openeing all of societies eyes to the power of linux and that linux replaces windows as the mainstram operating system. im so done dude.

sorry if some of these takes or sentences just dont make sense. the intent of this was just to slap my keyboard until i have drained all the damaging thoughts i have bouncing around in my head. i have slightly calmed down.

## Next Step

- find a windows window manager that is somewhat like i3
- put powertoys on startup so my keybinds actualy work, all the time
- uninstall all the bloat if that is possible

# STAY AWAY FROM WINDOWS IF POSSIBLE
if its for gaming ig i understand but if not, just please run dude.
ok thanks peace.
