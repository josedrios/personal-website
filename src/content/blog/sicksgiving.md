## I Got Sick 

I went out with my friends and got sick after that. I kept it at bay and was doing find until like a week in it ramped up a little. I feel like I got one sickness and then a week later I got another one. So I have just been sick for two weeks and it has been pretty annoying. I think I trained like once or twice within this period. The fluids in my head/brain seem to become more viscous or maybe its just in my head (pun very much intended). 

Yea it just has been very very irritating. Cought was prominent, then it was a runny nose and sneezing. Now a sore throat. Just all over the place but I truly feel it dying down, hopefully I didn't jinx it. I also start very early in the morning for my other job as well so I have been feeling really out of it this last week but once I recover by this weekend and go back into work again, the shifts should be more calm.  

## Thanksgiving

It was cool. A lot of food. Lot of family. Was very nice seeing everyone I love. Ate a lot. Also the same weekend went out with some family which was pretty cool. 

## Yet Another Break

To me it seems like I am always taking a break from something. In this case I was taking a break from coding once again but I tried to get back into but the sickness had me just wanting to do nothing mentally intensive. I did wireframe here and there, and brainstorm but no actual technical coding. Now that the sickness/thanksgiving break has finished, I find myself getting back into my old groove.

Just a random blog about my current state. No spell check. Happy late thanksgiving.
