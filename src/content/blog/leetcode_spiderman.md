## Leetcode

I talked to my neighbor a while back and he pointed me into a good direction on how I should navigate the job market, be a overall better programmer, etc. One of the things that came out of this conversation was leetcode. I have been doing a good amount of leetcode lately and I can definitely see that I have many holes in my skills to fill. 

### I Need to Get Better with Data Structures and Algorithms

I thought I knew a good amount, or at least the basics but leetcode really humbles you. I want to get better. A lot better. Like a lottttt better. I know getting better at leetcode doesn't directly 1 for 1 make you a better developer but there is for sure some over lap. 

These types of questions really tickle the programming muscle and at a consistent basis. I can definitely see how it can somewhat help me as a problem solver.

Thank you to my neighbor for taking the time out of their day to help me gain direction.

## Spiderman Game

Refreshing. If I had one word to describe how this game felt, it would be refreshing. Its like one of those games that you finish playing and you INSTANTLY realize that you just lived through peak. 

Otto was dope, Osborn was cool (feel like we didn't get enough but im assuming soon in later games?), Aunt May and the other characters were really cool but the traversing. Dude chefs kiss.

Only thing bad about the game is during those cinematics where they want you to press one button to act like you are still steering the ship. Like dude I am not a child, just finish the cutscene/cinematic, I'll be alright. I dont want to have to press circle for the most stupidest, anticlimatic thing. Its like giving a dead controller to a toddler to keep them satisfied. Like Im a grown ah man dude come on. 

Other than that 9.5/10, really good game. Amazing.

Spiderman was amazing.

Amazing...

...the Amazing Spiderman.

## Website

Been working on a website. Been going good I would say. Learning a lot. My typescript skills have 100% definitely increased. I can see the vish on why people like TS. I can visualize the flow of TS better to some extent. But the website is going good.

## Life

I have been working a lot. Balancing work, programming, and gym has been a quiet the task but its going. Im still trying to get adapted to it. Also getting a new desk job that should implement more stability in my life so I am excited about that. Other than that the main things I am excited about in life is essentially friends/family, coding, gym, gaming/shows/movies and trying to "grow" as a person. I also want to shave my head but im a scaredy cat. I know Ill look even more chopped than I already am but its more of a convenience thing. I dont get too much play anyways so there wont be a difference there.

### 315 Bench

Speaking about "growing" as a person. I am stuck at 205lb for 5 to 6 reps. Long way to go.

## Whats to Come

### Coding

Leetcode, keeping working on the website I am working on and hopefully eventially deploy it to start a small cool community. Then redo my personal website to look a bit cooler (also to get my feet wet with Next.js more)

### Gym

Get bigger, leaner, healthier, stronger and faster.

### Self

Less scrolling on random platforms. Turn the volume down on music. Less music. Less dopamine, less stimulus, be comfortable being or doing bored things. Love more. Eat better. Be more brave. Respect more. Be me more. Find me. Better posture. Read more. 

### Media

Movies: Watching a lot more classics, view an actors life work (like all their movies) or even a director

Games (Current Roadmap in Order):
1. Life is Strange (current)
2. Portal 2
3. Final Fantasy 7 - original
4. Doom 2016

Shows:
- Jojos (dabbling with rn)
- Sopranos
